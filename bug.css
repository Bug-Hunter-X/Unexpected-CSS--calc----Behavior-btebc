The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit handling. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 20);` will likely result in an error because `20` lacks a unit.  Another potential issue is nested `calc()` expressions without proper parentheses, leading to incorrect calculations.
